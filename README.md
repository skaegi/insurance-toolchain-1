# Cloud Insurance Co. - Toolchain

This toolchain deploys the [Cloud Insurance Co.](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/cloudco-insurance) project.

Get started with this project, which is an online insurance application that consists of microservices:

* [insurance-catalog][catalog_github_url] - An API to retrieve and update a catalog of insurance policies
* [insurance-orders][orders_github_url] - An API to retrieve and update a list of insurance policy orders made by customers
* [insurance-bot][bot_github_url] - UI that provides a chat bot interface for users to query their health benefits and file claims.
* [insurance-bot-dashboard][dashboard_github_url] - A user interface showing an history of the bot chats for further analysis.
* [insurance-bot-ios][ios_github_url] - An iOS application for the chat bot.
* [insurance-bot-android][android_github_url] - An Android application for the chat bot.

## Create the toolchain

1. It is recommended to create a new space in your organization. This helps grouping the apps and services together in the console.

  > :warning: After you have create the toolchain, you will need to perform a manual step to import the Watson Conversation workspace into the chat bot. Refer to [these instructions](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/insurance-bot#importWorkspace) to complete the configuration.

  Clicking it will:
  * **create 4 GitHub repositories** with the required source code for all the application components;
  * **instantiate the toolchain** in your Bluemix org and space;
  * **trigger the toolchain**, thereby deploying the selected branches (default to master) for all application components.


The toolchain is preconfigured for:

- issue tracking
- source control
- continuous delivery and integration (CI/CD)
- unit and code coverage testing
- blue-green deployment
